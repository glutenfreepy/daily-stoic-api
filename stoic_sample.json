They cannot undo the choices theyhave made or the hurt they have caused. But they can change the future\u2014through the power they have inthe present moment. As Epictetus said, they can control the choices they make right now.The same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within ourcontrol and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over otherpeople who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle."

Right now we might be laid low with struggles,whereas just a few years ago we might have lived high on the hog, and in just a few days we might bedoing so well that success is actually a burden. One thing will stay constant: our freedom of choice\u2014bothin the big picture and small picture.Ultimately, this is clarity. Whoever we are, wherever we are\u2014what matters is our choices. What arethey? How will we evaluate them? How will we make the most of them? Those are the questions life asksus, regardless of our station. How will you answer?"

Ourjudgment affects what we desire, our desires affect how we act, just as our judgment determines how weact. But we can\u2019t just expect this to happen.

If we feel that we\u2019ve been wrongedand get angry, of course that\u2019s how it will seem. If we raise our voice because we feel we\u2019re beingconfronted, naturally a confrontation will ensue.But if we retain control of ourselves, we decide whether to label something good or bad. In fact, ifthat same event happened to us at different points in our lifetime, we might have very different reactions.So why not choose now to not apply these labels? Why not choose not to react?"

Well, if you take a second to considersex in such an absurd light, you may be less likely to do something shameful or embarrassing in the pursuitof it.

Consider that envy-inducing photo you see on social media\u2014imagine the person painstakingly staging it. What about that jobpromotion that means so much? Look at the lives of other so-called successful people. Still think it holdsmagical power? Money, which we want more of and are reluctant to part with\u2014consider how covered inbacteria and filth it is. That beautiful, perfect person you\u2019re admiring from afar?

First, you ought to live your own life insuch a way that it doesn\u2019t negatively impose on others. Second, you have to be open-minded andaccepting enough to let others do the same.Can you do that? Even when you really, really disagree with the choices they\u2019re making? Can youunderstand that their life is their business and yours is your own? And that you\u2019ve got plenty to wrestlewith yourself without bothering anyone else?"

Especially when those feelings end up making us feel worse.It\u2019s also another bit of evidence that the Stoics were hardly some depressing, bitter group of old men.Even when things were really bad, when the world made them want to weep in despair or rage, theychose to laugh about it.Like Democritus, we can make that same choice.

Seneca was so rich that some historians speculate that major loans he madeto the inhabitants of what is now Britain caused what became a horrifically brutal uprising there. Hiscritics\u2019 derisive nickname for him was \u201cThe Opulent Stoic.\u201dSeneca\u2019s response to this criticism is pretty simple: he might have wealth, but he didn\u2019t need it. Hewasn\u2019t dependent on it or addicted to it. Nor, despite his large bank account, was he considered to beanything close to Rome\u2019s most lavish spenders and pleasure hunters. Whether his rationalization was trueor not (or whether he was a tad hypocritical), his is a decent prescription for navigating today\u2019smaterialistic and wealth-driven society.This is the pragmatic instead of the moralistic approach to wealth.We can still live well without becoming slaves to luxury. And we don\u2019t need to make decisions thatforce us to continue to work and work and work and drift further from study and contemplation in order toget more money to pay for the things we don\u2019t need.

How would he deal with it? Well, at the very least, his instincts were tocomfort his mother instead of simply bemoaning his own suffering. Though some other letters show thatSeneca begged and lobbied for his return to Rome and power (a request eventually granted), he seems tohave borne the pain and disgrace of exile fairly well. The philosophy that he\u2019d long studied prepared himfor this kind of adversity and gave him the determination and patience he needed to wait it out. When hefound his fortune restored as he returned to power, philosophy prevented him from taking it for granted orbecoming dependent on it.

Which is most resilient inthe face of trials and tribulations? Which will never abandon you? Seneca\u2019s own life is an interestingexample. He became quite wealthy as a friend of the emperor, but as Nero became more and morederanged, Seneca realized he needed to get out. He offered Nero a deal: he would give Nero all hismoney and return all of Nero\u2019s gifts in exchange for complete and total freedom.Ultimately, Nero rejected this offer, but Seneca left anyway, retiring in relative peace. But one day, theexecutioners came with their mortal decree. In that moment, what did Seneca rely on? It wasn\u2019t his money.It wasn\u2019t his friends, who, although they meant well, were a considerable source of grief and mourning. Itwas his virtue and inner strength.It was Seneca\u2019s most trying moment\u2014his last and his finest."

Perhaps thatwas because life in Greece and Rome was particularly harsh. Animals and people were slaughteredsenselessly to amuse the masses in the Colosseum (events lamented in the Stoic writings). Countries wereconquered and its citizens sold into slavery to expand the empire (the futility of which the Stoics alsolamented). This kind of cruelty is possible only when we forget how we\u2019re related to our fellow humanbeings and the environment.Today, take a moment to remember that we are woven together and that each of us plays a role (good,bad, or ugly) in this world."

And just asShakespeare observed in Macbeth, \u201cBloody instructions, which, being taught, return / To plagueth\u2019inventor,\u201d Seneca\u2019s collaboration with Nero ultimately ended with the student murdering the teacher.It\u2019s something to think about when you consider whom to work with and whom to do business with inlife. If you show a client how to do something unethical or illegal, might they return the favor to anunsuspecting you later on? If you provide a bad example to your employees, to your associates, to yourchildren, might they betray you or hurt you down the road? What goes around comes around, is the saying.Karma is a notion we have imported from the East, along similar lines.Seneca paid a price for his instructions to Nero.

Philosophy shouldn\u2019thave to accept what time or energy is left over from other occupations but instead we should graciouslymake time for those other pursuits only once our study is finished.If real self-improvement is what we\u2019re after, why do we leave our reading until those few minutesbefore we shut off the lights and go to bed?

Instead of simply accepting what happens, theyurge us to actually enjoy what has happened\u2014whatever it is. Nietzsche, many centuries later, coined theperfect expression to capture this idea: amor fati (a love of fate).

Though they may beenjoyable and help you lighten up, their aim is to help you sculpt and improve your life. And because allof us have but one life and one death, we should treat each experience like a sculptor with his chisels,carving until, to paraphrase Michelangelo, we set free the angel in the marble.We are trying to do this difficult thing\u2014living and dying\u2014as well as we can.

Especially when the people you\u2019re deferring to are such towering figures!It\u2019s harder (and more intimidating) to venture out on your own and express your own thoughts. Buthow do you think those wise and true quotes from those towering figures were created in the first place?Your own experiences have value. You have accumulated your own wisdom too. Stake your claim.

On one occasion, after being lifted out of a bath, the Roman asked, \u201cAm I sitting downyet?\u201d Seneca\u2019s point was essentially: What kind of sad pathetic life is it if you\u2019re so disconnected fromthe world that you don\u2019t even know whether you\u2019re on the ground? How did the man know whether hewas even alive at all?Most of us are afraid of dying. But sometimes this fear begs the question: To protect what exactly? Fora lot of people the answer is: hours of television, gossiping, gorging, wasting potential, reporting to aboring job, and on and on and on. Except, in the strictest sense, is this actually a life? Is this worthgripping so tightly and being afraid of losing?It doesn\u2019t sound like it."

Constant work gives rise to a certain kind of dullness andfeebleness in the rational soul.\u201d\u2014SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 17.5ne can\u2019t read Marcus Aurelius and Seneca and not be struck by the difference between these tworadically different personalities. Each had his own strengths and weaknesses. Which would yourather have entrusted with the immense responsibility of an empire? Probably Marcus. But who wouldyou rather be as a person? Probably Seneca.One of the reasons is that Seneca seems to have had what we would now refer to as work/life balance.Whereas Marcus can read as though he\u2019s worn down and tired, Seneca always feels energetic, fresh,robust. His philosophy of rest and relaxation\u2014intermixed with his rigorous study and other Stoic rituals\u2014probably had a lot to do with it.The mind is a muscle, and like the rest, it can be strained, overworked, even injured. Our physicalhealth is also worn down by overcommitment, a lack of rest, and bad habits. Remember the tall tale aboutJohn Henry\u2014the man who challenged the machine? He died of exhaustion at the end. Don\u2019t forget that.Today, you may face things that try your patience, require considerable focus or clarity, or demandcreative breakthroughs. Life is a long haul\u2014it will mean many such moments. Are you going to be able tohandle them if you\u2019ve burned the candle at both ends? If you\u2019ve been abusing and overworking yourbody?"

It\u2019s an inspiring example for us to think about today if we get tired, frustrated, or have to dealwith some crisis. Here was a guy who had every reason to be angry and bitter, who could have abandonedhis principles and lived in luxury or ease, who could have put his responsibilities aside and focused onhis own health.But he never did.

On your way up \u201cLibrary Way,\u201d you\u2019ll pass a gold placard laid into the cement,part of a series of quotations from great writers throughout history. This one is from Marcus Aurelius:\u201cEverything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered.\u201dThe library itself was designed by the firm of John Merven Carr\u00e8re, one of the twentieth century\u2019smost accomplished architects. It combines the collections of such luminaries and philanthropists asSamuel Tilden, John Jacob Astor, and James Lenox, and their names are carved into the stone. Today, thenaming rights go to hedge fund manager Stephen A. Schwarzman. The opening of the library in 1911 wasattended by President William Howard Taft, Governor John Alden Dix, and New York City mayorWilliam Jay Gaynor. The plaques you pass on your way were designed by the excellent Gregg LeFevre.Marcus\u2019s quote makes us ponder: How many of these people have we even heard of? The peopleinvolved in the story of the library were some of the most famous men in the world, masters of theirrespective crafts, rich beyond imagination in some cases. Even along \u201cLibrary Way,\u201d many of the famousauthors are unfamiliar to the modern reader. They are all long gone, as are the people who rememberedthem.All of us, including Marcus\u2014who is passed over by just as many unaware pedestrians\u2014last for just aday, at most."
